Basic exercises
- Change the loop bounds and print numbers divisible by 3 between 1..30.
- Implement a `while` that reads integers until 0 is entered, then prints their sum.

Edge / defensive coding
- Add input validation for the above program: ignore negative numbers and non-numeric input.
Exercises
- Rewrite the for-loop as a while-loop and a do-while-loop.
- Write a function to print all prime numbers up to N and test it for N=30.
