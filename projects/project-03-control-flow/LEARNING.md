project-03-control-flow â€” Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- `if`/`else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and loop control (`break`, `continue`)

Learning outcomes
- Translate real-world branching into control flow constructs; reason about loop invariants.

Exercises
- Handle negative numbers and zero; document decisions (e.g., treat negative as invalid input).
- Implement the same logic using `switch` where applicable.
- Refactor repetitive code into small functions.

Suggested tests
- Input sequences including negative, zero, and large values.
- Tests that ensure loops terminate and edge cases handled.
