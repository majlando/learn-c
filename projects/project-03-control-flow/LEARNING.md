Goal
- Show common control flow: `for`, `while`, `do`/`while`, `if` and `switch`.

What to learn
- Loop forms and their use-cases
- `switch` statements and fall-through behavior

Exercises
- Convert a `for` loop to `while` and `do`/`while`.
- Implement a small sieve or prime-checker for practice.

Note
- Keep outputs deterministic for automated tests.
