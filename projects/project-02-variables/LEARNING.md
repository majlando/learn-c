project-02-variables

Goals
- Explain variable types, formatting, and when to choose sizes (int, long, unsigned, float/double).

Topics covered
- Integer types, signed vs unsigned
- Floating point formatting and precision
- Characters and ASCII printing
- size_t and platform-sized types

Examples
- Print an int, a double with precision, a char, and a size_t value.

Exercises
- Change formats to print unsigned and long types, and compare outputs.

Suggested tests
- Verify formatting for different specifiers and precision.

project-02-variables — Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- Primitive types, initialization, literals, printing with `printf` format specifiers

Learning outcomes
- Understand storage and basic formatting; select correct format specifier for types.

Exercises
- Read values from stdin and echo them back with correct formatting.
- Demonstrate default initialization (local vs static) and print results.

Suggested tests
- Tests covering integer, floating, and character inputs.
- Tests for uninitialized variables (demonstration only — undefined behavior).

Further reading
- `printf` format specifiers, integer conversion, floating-point formatting.
