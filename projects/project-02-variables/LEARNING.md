project-02-variables — Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- Primitive types, initialization, literals, printing with `printf` format specifiers

Learning outcomes
- Understand storage and basic formatting; select correct format specifier for types.

Exercises
- Read values from stdin and echo them back with correct formatting.
- Demonstrate default initialization (local vs static) and print results.

Suggested tests
- Tests covering integer, floating, and character inputs.
- Tests for uninitialized variables (demonstration only — undefined behavior).

Further reading
- `printf` format specifiers, integer conversion, floating-point formatting.
