Goal
- Demonstrate common C data types and how to print them.

What to learn
- signed/unsigned integers, `long`, `long long`
- `float` vs `double`, `char` and C-strings
- `_Bool`, `size_t`, and pointer-sized integers

Exercises
- Read values from stdin and print them with correct format specifiers.
- Show what happens with a wrong `printf` specifier (explain UB).

Note
- Always match `printf` format specifiers to the argument types.
