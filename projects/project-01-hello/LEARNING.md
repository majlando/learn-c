Topics covered
- Program structure, `main`, `#include`, `printf`, return codes

Learning outcomes
- Students can build and run a C program, change a string constant, and understand exit codes.

Exercises
- Add user input: read a name with `fgets` and greet the user.
- Modify the program to accept a command-line argument and print it.
- Add a newline and explain why it's important for flushing output.

Suggested tests to add
- A test that runs the program with no input and verifies the greeting.
- A test that runs with a name argument and checks the personalized greeting.

Further reading
- Chapter: program structure and I/O basics; short exercises on `argc/argv`.
