Goal
- Demonstrate malloc/realloc/free with simple checks and deterministic output.

What to learn
- Allocate arrays, check for NULL, free memory, and use realloc safely.

Exercises
- Resize arrays with realloc while preserving contents and handling failures.

Build & test
- `build.ps1` and `build.sanitizer.ps1` (local sanitizers) are provided.
