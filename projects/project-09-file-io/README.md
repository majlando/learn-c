Lesson: File I/O

Objectives
- Read and write text and binary files, check for errors using `fopen`/`ferror`/`perror`.

Key points
- Always check `fopen` result before using file pointers.
- Use `fgets` for line-based input and `fread`/`fwrite` for binary data.

Hints
- Experiment with `fseek` and `ftell` to determine file size.
