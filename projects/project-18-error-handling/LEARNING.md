Improvements for project-18-error-handling

- Add exercises to return and handle error codes, and to wrap error messages consistently.
- Add tests for simulated errors (I/O failure, allocation failure) and verify graceful recovery.
- Introduce `errno` usage and show portable error reporting patterns.
