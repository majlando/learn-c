Goals
- Teach C string basics, safe copying, and common pitfalls.

Topics covered
- Null-termination, `strlen`, `strncpy`/`strlcpy` patterns, and `snprintf` usage
- Tokenization with `strtok` and re-entrant alternatives

Examples
- Build a greeting with `snprintf`, print its length, and safely copy into a smaller buffer.

Exercises
- Demonstrate `strtok` on a comma-separated string and implement a safe tokenizer.

Suggested tests
- Exact-length buffer, empty string, and long input tests.

Further reading
- Buffer overflows, safe string APIs, and secure coding practices.
