Lesson: Strings and buffers

Objectives
- Use `snprintf`, `strlen`, and safe string handling.
- Avoid modifying string literals; copy before tokenizing.

Try it
- Replace `strtok` with a reentrant-safe alternative in multi-threaded code.

Exercise
- Safely concatenate two strings into a fixed-size buffer using `snprintf`.
