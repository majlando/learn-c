Lesson: Structs & Composite Types

Objectives
- Define and use `struct` types, initialize them, and pass pointers to functions.

Key points
- Fixed-size char arrays inside structs need bounds-safe writes.
- Use designated initializers for readability.

Hints
- Try creating and returning a struct from a function (by value).
