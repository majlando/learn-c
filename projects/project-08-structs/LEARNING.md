project-08-structs â€” Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- Struct definition, nested structs, designated initializers, `typedef` and memory layout

Learning outcomes
- Model simple real-world data with structs and initialize them cleanly.

Exercises
- Implement a print/serialize function for a struct and demonstrate nested structs.
- Show memory padding and use `sizeof` to analyze layout.

Suggested tests
- Tests that validate field values and serialization output.
