Lesson: Structs and typedefs

Objectives
- Define and initialize `struct` types.
- Use `typedef` for readability and understand `enum` basics.

Try it
- Create a linked list node `struct` and write a tiny traversal to print nodes.

Exercise
- Add an `enum` for colors and use it in a struct field; print the numeric value.
