project-08-structs

Goals
- Introduce structs, initializing, and accessing fields; show simple aggregation of values.

What to keep in this lesson
- A small example constructing a struct and printing its fields for deterministic output.

Exercises
- Add functions that accept structs by value and by pointer; explore sizeof and alignment.

Build & test
- Use `build.ps1` to compile and run the example.

project-08-structs â€” Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- Struct definition, nested structs, designated initializers, `typedef` and memory layout

Learning outcomes
- Model simple real-world data with structs and initialize them cleanly.

Exercises
- Implement a print/serialize function for a struct and demonstrate nested structs.
- Show memory padding and use `sizeof` to analyze layout.

Suggested tests
- Tests that validate field values and serialization output.
