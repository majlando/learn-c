Objectives
- Understand pointers, `NULL` checks, and pointer-to-pointer basics.
- Know when to use `const` to express intent.

Try it
- Add a function that swaps two integers via pointers (already shown) and test it.

Exercise
- Implement a safe `strdup` wrapper that returns `NULL` on allocation failure.
