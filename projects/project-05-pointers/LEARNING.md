project-05-pointers â€” Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- Pointer basics, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, `const` pointers, pointer to pointer

Learning outcomes
- Understand how pointers reference memory, how to use them for in-place modification.

Exercises
- Implement `swap(int *a, int *b)` and test with different values.
- Demonstrate pointer arithmetic on arrays, and show pointer aliasing pitfalls.
- Visualize stack vs heap addresses.

Suggested tests
- Tests for swap correctness and pointer arithmetic bounds.

Further reading
- Undefined behavior and how to avoid common pointer errors.
