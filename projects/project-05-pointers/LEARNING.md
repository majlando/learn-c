Goal
- Teach pointer basics: `&`, `*`, pointer arithmetic, and pointer-to-pointer.

What to learn
- Basic dereference and address-of operations
- Pointer arithmetic vs array indexing
- Pointer-to-pointer usage

Exercises
- Implement and test `swap(int *a, int *b)`.
- Rewrite an array loop using pointer arithmetic.

Note
- Only dereference valid pointers to avoid UB.
