Goal
- Demonstrate functions, headers, and pointer parameters.

What to learn
- Declaration vs definition, `static` linkage
- Passing pointers to modify caller-owned variables

Exercises
- Add simple checks for `add3` and implement `swap_int`.

Note
- Compile `math.c` together with `main.c` to avoid linker errors.
