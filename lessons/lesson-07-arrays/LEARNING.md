project-07-arrays

Goals
- Demonstrate fixed-size arrays, iteration, and the relationship between arrays and pointers.

Topics covered
- One- and two-dimensional arrays
- Calculating lengths with sizeof
- Common off-by-one pitfalls

Examples
- Iterate a small numeric array and print indices/values.

Exercises
- Implement a function that sums an array and returns the result.

Suggested tests
- Boundary tests for index access and multi-dimensional indexing.

project-07-arrays â€” Goals & improvements

Topics covered
- Single and multidimensional arrays, indexing, pointer/array relationship

Learning outcomes
- Use arrays safely, understand memory layout and differences from dynamic allocation.

Exercises
- Implement matrix sum and row/column traversal.
- Compare static arrays vs dynamic allocation for large sizes.

Suggested tests
- Tests for boundary indices and multidimensional indexing correctness.
